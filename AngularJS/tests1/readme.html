-----------------

Note:
if you call angular js script (from google) at the bottom of the page then you might see
{{ value }} <-- those brackets briefly when page loads
You can stop this by
1. Moving the code to call angularjs (from the google library i.e the <script src="//code.google.com/angular....whatever" to the <head> section
2. or start document this way (adding ng cloak)
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app="app3" ng-cloak>
	<head>
		<style>
		[ng\:cloak], [ng-cloak], .ng-cloak {
		display: none;
		}
		</style>
	</head>
